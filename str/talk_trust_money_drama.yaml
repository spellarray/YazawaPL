    Translated: One night at Survive Bar, Nanba spotted a bottle of Legend Malt, a high-end whisky priced at 10,000 yen a glass. Nanba decided to sneak a sip while the bartender was away, but the whisky was so tantalizingly delicious that he ended up drinking the whole bottle without giving it a second thought. He then ran off to a convenience store, filled the empty bottle with cheap booze, and returned it to the shelf. Despite his quick thinking, however, Nanba was still worried he would eventually be found out. Upon consulting Kasuga, the two decided to wait and see what happened next...

    Translated: As fate would have it, Futaba was just a stage name, and the hostess Kasuga thought would bring him closer to Mizue turned out to be Mizue herself. For Nanba's sake, Kasuga had Mizue assume the role of the girl Nanba once knew and pretend to leave the country, though it was clear Nanba must've known the truth. In spite of his awareness, however, Nanba was just happy to know how hard Kasuga worked to give him closure. Moved by Kasuga's generosity, Nanba then began to see Kasuga as one of the truest friends he could ever ask for.

Takashi asked Adachi to lend him the money, but seeing as Adachi is only pretending to be rich, there's simply no way Adachi can afford to pay for it. Thinking 1,000,000 yen might be way too high a price for a scratched bumper, Kasuga and Adachi began to question if Takashi is being conned. Adachi then agreed to meet for an out-of-court settlement.

    Translated: Saeko had always taken care of her twin sister, Nanoha. However, after telling Nanoha to lose her troublemaking boyfriend, Saeko was met with intense backlash from both her sister and her father. Following an intense fight, Saeko left home, and hasn't seen Nanoha since. Though it pains her to say it, Saeko revealed that, even now, Nanoha refuses to ask for her sister's help, no matter how much she may need it.

However, after telling Nanoha to lose her troublemaking boyfriend, Saeko was met with intense backlash from both her sister and her father. Following an intense fight, Saeko left home, and hasn't seen Nanoha since. Though it pains her to say it, Saeko revealed that, even now, Nanoha refuses to ask for her sister's help, no matter how much she may need it.

    Translated: The biggest thing causing Nanoha to distance herself from Saeko is Nanoha's boyfriend, Katsuragawa. Katsuragawa claims he runs a consulting firm, but in actuality he's nothing more than a criminalâ€”complete with a bodyguard and whole slew of scandalous rumors to prove it. To make matters worse, Nanoha's still going out with him. Having just learned this, Saeko asked some of the girls from the club to monitor Nanoha's movements, leaving Saeko to wait and worry.

    Translated: Katsuragawa's still got Nanoha charmed, and it turns out he's even made a habit of asking her for money since his company entered a slump. He's also learned that Nanoha once worked at Otohime Land and has started pressuring her to work there again. Hearing all of this, Saeko then decided she'd try talking to Nanoha over the phone, hoping her sister might reconsider her relationship with her seedy boyfriend...

    Translated: Katsuragawa proved that he was indeed a good-for-nothing who only got close to Nanoha for her money. On the bright side, however, one of Katsuragawa's posse, Yamashita, revealed he'd always had a soft spot for Nanoha and had fallen for her. Yamashita then betrayed Katsuragawa and asked that he let Nanoha go. Kasuga then made Katsuragawa promise to leave Ijincho. Concerned for Nanoha and Saeko's relationship, Yamashita said he'd tell Nanoha that Katsuragawa skipped town on account of his failed business. He also assured Saeko that her sister would know nothing about her involvement in Katsuragawa leaving. No telling quite how Nanoha and Yamashita will end up, but it's clear that Nanoha won't have to worry about her sister as much anymore—someday she'll realize just how helpful her sister has been. Saeko thanked Kasuga for helping her sister out once again, bringing the duo that much closer.

    Translated: Eri Kamataki, president of Ichiban Confections, wanted to pass off her company to the all-too-familiar Nonomiya, who dreamed of creating a company that could house Ijincho's down and out. However, news of Nonomiya's death left her feeling so defeated, she considered closing the company, revealing it to be on the verge of bankruptcy and in serious need of staff. Hoping to follow in Nonomiya's footsteps and help Eri in her time of need, Kasuga decided to step in and become the new president of Ichiban Confections, even though he knows next to nothing about business. Determined to support Kasuga, Eri volunteered to be his secretary, taking her first step in what could very well become a beautiful partnership.

Nick Ogata also seemed to share in the sentiment of seeing Hosho knocked from his perch, as he revealed his other reason for funding Ichiban Confections was to release Yokohama from Hosho's domineering grip and return the marketplace to its former glory.

However, by the time Zhao came to power, the Snake Flower Triad had all but disappeared, leaving only the Ijin Three.

    Translated: Hoping to return to Ijincho, Mabuchi sent his underling Zheng to Survive Bar to ask for Zhao's forgiveness. However, this ended up being a trap, as Mabuchi's true motive was to take Zhao's head to the Omi Alliance and join their ranks. Left with no other choice, Zhao decided to let his fists do the talking. Regardless of all Mabuchi had done, Zhao professed that he would never kill someone he once called a friend, a fact Seong-hui was well aware of. Mabuchi was defeated and exiled once again, receiving yet another act of undeserved kindness... With all said and done, Kasuga expressed that he enjoyed seeing Zhao's compassionate side, much to Zhao's embarrassment. The two then sat down for some drinks, their friendship now stronger than ever.

    Translated: Joon-gi Han's father was a member of the Jingweon Mafia who had been sent to Kamurocho during the organization's heyday. However, by the end of the 1980s, the Jingweon Mafia in Kamurocho had been virtually wiped out. Unable to receive support from those back home in Korea, Joon-gi Han and his father were left to fend for themselves. How did this man become a body double of the Jingweon Mafia leader? Why does he continue to call himself Joon-gi Han? Joon-gi Han simply smiled in response to these questions, leaving the truth to remain shrouded in mystery...

    Translated: According to the Geomijul's intel, some suspicious people have been sniffing around Ijincho. Joon-gi Han surmised that they might be remnants of Kamurocho's Jingweon, and, if that's the case, they've most likely come to punish him for carrying on the mantle of the real Joon-gi Han. Joon-gi Han urged Kasuga to be careful.

    Translated: Joon-gi Han revealed his real name, Yeonsu Kim. Yeonsu then revealed that, in a desperate attempt to stay relevant within the Jingweon Mafia, his father offered him up as a body double to the real Joon-gi Han. Yeonsu was drugged and his face was altered to look like that of the Jingweon's new leader. Sympathetic to the young Yeonsu, the real Joon-gi Han was unable to turn him away, and it was decided the boy would serve as his body double. This plan unfortunately fell apart when the real Joon-gi Han was killed, leaving Yeonsu purposeless and alone. It was then he found out about Geomijul, a place where stray Jingweon Mafia members were welcomed with open arms. Having heard Yeonsu's tragic story, Kasuga felt as though they'd finally become friends.

    Translated: The suspicious figures tailing Joon-gi Han managed to evade the eyes of the Geomijul, and now lie in wait. Could they really be the Jingweon Mafia, seeking to punish Yeonsu for impersonating their late leader? Why doesn't he just drop the act? Kasuga suggested it may be time to put the routine to an end, but Yeonsu insisted on remaining Joon-gi Han. He knows very well that he could be attacked at any moment or create trouble for his allies, but seeing Kasuga keep calm enticed Yeonsu to flaunt yet another of his signature smiles.

    Translated: Yeonsu explained that he continues to play the role of Joon-gi Han for the sake of the Jingweon who have lost their place in the world. Seeing as Geomijul provided a home for him and so many others in the Jingweon Mafia, Yeonsu hoped that continuing the Joon-gi Han routine would bring his scattered comrades to Ijincho and ultimately to the safety of Geomijul. Upon hearing this, the Jingweon who initially saw Yeonsu as a traitor apologized and took hold of his helping hand. With no more secrets between them, Kasuga and Yeonsu, or rather Joon-gi Han, raised a glass to one another and drank the night away.
