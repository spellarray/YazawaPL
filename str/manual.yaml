      During your turn, place one card from your hand on the table.


      If there is another card of the same suit on the table, the pair is yours.


      If there are no other cards of the same suit on the table, your card stays on the table.


      After playing a card from your hand, immediately draw a card from the deck and place that on the table, claiming a pair if possible.

      Upon forming a specific combination with your cards, you will be given the option to call "Koi."


      <color=mg_relu_topic>Call "Koi"</color>

      Keep your current hand and try to form more combinations.

      Oicho-kabu is played with a deck of 40 cards. Each card has a value

      between 1 and 10, and there are four of each card. (4 x 10 = 40!)


      There are four players, but one of them is the dealer, who plays

      against the other three. We'll refer to these three as the players.


      The goal of the game is to get the sum of your cards as close as

      possible to 9. But if your sum exceeds 9, only the last digit counts!

      So if your total is 11, you actually have a 1.

      The game begins with four cards being dealt face-up on the table,

      and each player chooses one card to bet on.


      Next, each player receives an additional card from the deck.


      From there, you must make a choice. Stick with your two cards,

      or draw a third card from the deck to add to your total.

      Now let's talk about the dealer, who goes after the players.

      Like blackjack, their goal is to defeat each player in a showdown.


      The dealer functions just like the players, except that after drawing

      two cards, they can initiate the showdown against players they

      can already defeat, and then draw a third card to try to defeat

      the remaining players. In a tie, the dealer wins. The dealer is powerful.

      Four players compete to be the first to complete a 14-tile hand.

      This hand is typically composed of 4 groups of 3-tile combinations and 1 pair. 


      The point value of a player's hand is determined by the tiles they have collected.

      For a list of mahjong hands, please refer to Hands. 


      Each player takes turns drawing and discarding tiles to construct their hand to reach the win condition.

      In addition to drawing them, players can steal certain tiles that their opponents discard.

      As you play through a game, you will draw and discard tiles while trying to

      form sets of straights and three-of-a-kinds to meet the win condition.

      As you play through a game, you will draw and discard tiles while trying to

      form sets of straights and three-of-a-kinds to meet the win condition.

      Immediately after an opponent discards a tile, you can claim and add it to your hand, creating

      a "meld." Melds are divided into Pon, Chi, and Kan, explained on the next page.


      Several scoring elements are only valid in concealed hands and others are reduced in value when

      a player has one or more exposed melds, so remember, steal wisely.

      If an opponent discards a tile that completes a 3-number straight, that tile can be claimed and melded

      to form a set by selecting "Chi." You can only steal a tile from the opponent sitting to your left for

      this meld.</color> If an opponent discards a tile that matches a pair in your hand, that tile can be

      claimed and melded to form a triplet by selecting "Pon."


      If you have a triplet and an opponent discards a fourth matching tile, you can select "Kan" to claim

      it and form an exposed kan. If you have an exposed pon and draw the fourth tile, you may select

      "Kan" to upgrade that pon into a kan. Each time a kan is announced, a new dora (bonus tile) is

      revealed.

      Darts is a simple game where you aim for numbers on a board.


      Press <symbol=button_decide> to throw your dart where your cursor is aimed.


      The dark pink area on the power gauge is called the Sweet Spot.


      Press <symbol=button_decide> when the marker hits the Sweet Spot to throw with perfect aim.


      Applying too much or too little power will make your dart fly low or high.

      Players take turns lowering their score with every dart they throw.


      The first player to reach exactly 0 wins the game.

      Going under 0 is called a bust.

      When a player busts, their score is reset to what they had at the start of the round and their turn is over.

      Cricket is a strategic game where players aim to control territory on a limited board (15-20 plus bull's-eye).


      Hitting an available target earns one mark. Get three marks to control that territory.

      Singles add one mark, doubles add two marks, and triples add three marks.


      Get three marks on a number to open that territory for scoring. Be careful, because your opponent can score on it too.


      If an opened territory is scored on three times, it becomes closed and unavailable for further scoring.

      Whoever has the most points at the end of the final round wins.

      First, select a direction for your shot with <symbol=button_l_stick>.

      Then press <symbol=button_batsu> to start charging up the power gauge.

      When the gauge reaches the power you want, press <symbol=button_batsu> again to confirm.

      The gauge will then start to swing back down, so press <symbol=button_batsu> once again to determine your shot's accuracy.

      Stop the marker in the red zone for perfect accuracy, or to the left and 

      right of the red zone to add spin to your shot.

      If you do not stop the marker in the red or yellow zones, you will whiff.

      by pressing <symbol=button_maru>.

      In this mode, your goal is to get as close to the flag as possible with each shot. 

      You will earn more points the closer you get. 

      Your final score will be the total points from each of the 10 rounds. 

      Scoring 100 points will earn you a reward and unlock the next level of difficulty.

      Higher final scores will lead to better rewards!

      Blackjack is a game where you get the numbers of your cards as close as you can to 21.

      You win if the total of your hand is closer to 21 than that of the dealer.

      A two-card hand consisting of an Ace and either a King, Queen, Jack, or 10 is called a blackjack.

      This is the best possible hand in the game, and will return 2.5 times your original bet (unless the dealer also has blackjack).


      If you go over 21, you bust, meaning you lose.



      Counting Card Values


      An Ace can be valued either at 1 or 11, depending on which is more convenient for your hand.

      10, J, Q, and K are all valued at 10.

      <color=mg_relu_topic>Moving Pieces</color>

      Piece movement differs from piece to piece. How each piece can be

      moved will be explained in the coming pages.


      <color=mg_relu_topic>Promotion</color>

      The first three rows on the opponent's side of the board are the

      promotion zone. Once certain pieces reach that zone, they will be

      promoted and their available movements will change.

      When one of your pieces lands on an opponent's piece, you capture that piece.

      If you capture a promoted piece, it is flipped back over to its original state.

      On the turn following, you may opt to drop that piece on select squares.

      You cannot move a dropped piece until the turn after you drop it.

      Each quest you complete earns you Member Points.

      Collecting these points improves Kasuga's Member Rank, granting him access to special weapons and more lucrative quests.

      Take on tougher quests to earn more Member Points at once.

      According to the founder, true heroes need to be heroic on the inside too.

      As such, Challenge Quests were developed to foster character development and a healthy hero lifestyle.


      There are four categories of Challenge Quests: Adventure, Battle, Minigame, and Management.

      Complete these quests to earn EXP and develop your personality.


      Any Challenge Quests completed before encountering Hiro will yield their rewards upon meeting him.

      This is a <color=mg_rule_strong>business management simulation</color> in which Kasuga takes on the role of company president in order to bring Ichiban Confections straight to the top.


      If you want to become the best company in Yokohama, you'll have to reach the <color=mg_rule_strong>number 1 spot in the Share Price Ranking.</color>


      Management is played out in two phases: day-to-day business and Shareholder Meetings. Kasuga will run the business a total of four times then give a financial report at the Shareholder Meeting at the end of each period.


      In keeping with good business practices, Kasuga cannot use company funds as his personal piggy bank, nor can he use any of his personal funds to fund the company.

      Improving a property will increase its selling price. Try to sell a property without improving it, and the selling price will be well below what you paid for it, so be sure to sell with careful consideration.


      Should you re-purchase a property you've previously sold, the improvements will remain intact. Naturally, this means that the property value has gone up, so the purchase price will be higher than when you originally purchased it.

      grow your company and meet people around town.

      Leave no street, alley, or highway unexplored, and do your very best to find as many promising employees as possible.


      <color=mg_rule_strong>[Surplus Labor Costs]</color>

      Employees that are not placed on properties will have their wages totaled as surplus labor costs.

      These employees are essentially "no work and all pay," so it's best to either assign them to properties and put them to work or adjust your number of employees.

      Lay off an employee. This saves on personnel costs

      but also reduces the satisfaction of all employees, so you'll want to do this carefully.

      You can finance your business through banks, moneylenders, and cash advances.


      Interest and the number of scheduled payments will differ depending on whom you borrow from, so it's best to consider your situation before you decide.


      Should you have the funds to make a lump-sum payment, you can select the lender from Debts and pay off your loan in one fell swoop.

      Five questions pertaining to the subject of the license will be presented.

      The exam is multiple choice with one correct response per question, each of which has a time limit.
       If the timer runs out on a question, it will be marked as incorrect, so pacing is key!
      Once a passing score is attained, which is different for each license, the license will be provided.

      The first time you attain a license, a specific Personality trait will increase. After that, you can retake it for free as a mock exam, but it won't increase your Personality.

    Translated: You can listen in on short conversations that happen between your party members around the city by pressing <symbol=button_sankaku>. Listen until the end, and you'll strengthen the bond between you and your party members. Interrupting these conversations by opening menus or triggering a battle will not only force everyone to stop talking, but it's also just plain rude. Luckily, should something like this happen, you can always go back to the spot where the chat began and listen again from the beginning.

      When you bump a rival's kart or get struck by an offensive item, your kart's durability will decrease, as displayed at the bottom of the screen.


      Should your kart's durability deplete, you will crash and lose time.

      <color=mg_rule_strong>[Progress of Battle]</color>

      The Q&A battle starts when the player selects a shareholder to ask their question. Fail to select someone quickly enough, and the shareholders' irritation gauge will begin to fill. Once completely filled, they will start voicing their opinions whether you've selected them or not.


      <color=mg_rule_strong>[Player's Attack]</color>

      Your employees will have a chance to attack by refuting the shareholders' opinions. By using command power and giving orders, your employees will make remarks about your company. Your command power will fill up slowly over time.


      You will only have a small window of time to refute the shareholders' opinions, but should you succeed, you will deal damage to the shareholders. Fail, however, and your employees will take damage.

      The number of counterarguments required to refute a critique changes depending on their affinity.


      When you successfully refute a critique, a <color=mg_rule_strong>counter chance</color> will occur.

      Ah, ten dreszczyk emocji gdy gonisz jakiegoś złamasa.


      Biegnij przez miasto omijając przeszkody przez wciskanie odpowiednich przycisków. Wskaźnik Odległości informuje ile metrów brakuje Celowi do ucieczki. Gdy wyniesie 0, ucieknie.

      Ah, the thrill of the chase.


      Navigate the city without bumping into obstacles by pressing the displayed inputs to catch up with your target. The distance gauge tracks how far away the target needs to get before you lose them.

    Translated: Interacting with a party member will fill your bond gauge with them. Fill up a certain amount, and you will trigger a Drink Link. Learning about your party members' secret pasts or grievances will further deepen your bonds with them. Strong bonds can give excellent status boosts in battle, so it never hurts to be a friend. (Some sequences may not trigger until you pass a specific point in the main story.)

    Translated: Fill up a party member's Bond Gauge enough, and the icon above their head will change. You can then speak to them at Survive Bar to trigger a Drink Link.
