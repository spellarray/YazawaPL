      Corporation ("Microsoft") for the Microsoft software that accompanies this EULA,

      which includes computer software and may include associated media, printed materials,

      2. ADDITIONAL LICENSE RIGHTS.

      In addition to the rights granted in Section 1, certain portions of the Software,

      as described in this Section 2, are provided to you with additional license rights.

      These additional license rights are conditioned upon your compliance with the

      distribution requirements and license restrictions described in Section 3.


      2.1 Sample Code.


      (a) Microsoft grants you the right to: (a) use and modify the source code

      version of those portions of the Software identified as "Samples" in the

      Software ("Sample Code") for the sole purposes of designing, developing,

      and testing your software product(s), and (b) a limited, nonexclusive,

      royalty-free right to reproduce

      and distribute the Sample Code, along with any modifications thereof, in

      object and/or source code form. For applicable redistribution requirements

      for Sample Code, see Section 3 below.

      (b) Software Sample Code is identified as all of the files in the following

      directories on the Software CD/Download:


      <Installed SDK Location>\DXSdk\Samples\VB.Net

      <Installed SDK Location>\DXSdk\Samples\C++

      <Installed SDK Location>\DXSdk\Samples\C#

      <Installed SDK Location>\DXSdk\Samples\Media

      <SDK CD ROOT>\Extras\Direct3D\Tools

      <SDK CD ROOT>\Extras\DirectShow


      2.2 Redistributable Code. Microsoft grants you a nonexclusive, royalty-free

      right to reproduce and distribute the object code form of any portion of the

      Software listed in \DXSDK\License\DirectX Redist.TXT and SDK CD

      ROOT>\Essentials\DirectMusic Style

      Library\ ("Redistributable Code"). For general redistribution requirements

      for Redistributable Code, see Section 3 below.


      3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND LICENSE LIMITATIONS.

      If you choose to exercise your rights under Section 2, any redistribution by

      you is subject to your compliance with Section 3.


      3.1 General Distribution Requirements.


      (a) If you choose to redistribute Sample Code, or Redistributable Code

      (collectively, the "Redistributables") as described in Section 2, you agree:

      (i) except as otherwise noted in Section 2.1 (Sample Code), to distribute the

      Redistributables only in object code form and in conjunction with and as a

      part of a software application product developed by you that adds significant

      and primary functionality to the Redistributables ("Licensee Software");

      (ii) that the Redistributables only operate in conjunction

      with Microsoft Windows platforms; (iii) that if the Licensee Software is

      distributed beyond Licensee's premises or externally from Licensee's

      organization, to distribute the Licensee Software containing the

      Redistributables pursuant to an end user license agreement (which may be

      "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed), with terms no less protective

      than those contained in this EULA; (iv) not to use Microsoft's name,

      logo, or trademarks to market the Licensee Software; (v) to display your own

      valid copyright notice which shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft's

      copyright in the Software; (vi) not to remove or obscure any copyright,

      trademark or patent notices that appear on the Software as delivered to you;

      (vii) to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against any

      claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the

      use or distribution of the Licensee Software; (viii) to otherwise comply with

      the terms of this EULA; and (ix) agree that Microsoft reserves all rights not

      expressly granted.

      You also agree not to permit further distribution of the Redistributables by

      your end users except you may permit further redistribution of the

      Redistributables by your distributors to your end-user customers if your

      distributors only distribute the Redistributables in conjunction with, and as

      part of, the Licensee Software, you comply with all other terms of this EULA,

      and your distributors comply with all restrictions of this EULA that are

      applicable to you.

      (b) If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your compliance with

      the applicable distribution requirements described for the Redistributables,

      the following also applies. Your license rights to the Redistributables are

      conditioned upon your not (i) creating derivative works of the Redistributables

      in any manner that would cause the Redistributables in whole or in part to

      become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License; or (ii) distributing

      the Redistributables (or derivative works thereof) in any manner that would

      cause the Redistributables to become subject to any of the terms of an

      Excluded License. An "Excluded License" is any license that requires as a

      condition of use, modification and/or distribution of software subject to the

      Excluded License, that such software or other software combined and/or

      distributed with such software be (x) disclosed or distributed in source code

      form; (y) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or

      (z) redistributable at no charge.


      4. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP. Microsoft reserves all rights not

      expressly granted to you in this EULA. The Software is protected by copyright

      and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Microsoft or its suppliers

      own the title, copyright, and other intellectual property rights in the Software.

      The Software is licensed, not sold.

      5. LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE ENGINEERING, DECOMPILATION, AND DISASSEMBLY.

      You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except

      and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable

      law notwithstanding this limitation.

      6. NO RENTAL/COMMERCIAL HOSTING. You may not rent, lease, lend or provide

      commercial hosting services with the Software.

      7. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA. You agree that Microsoft and its affiliates may

      collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support

      services provided to you, if any, related to the Software. Microsoft may use

      this information solely to improve our products or to provide customized

      services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in

      a form that personally identifies you.

      8. LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES. You may link to third party sites through the

      use of the Software. The third party sites are not under the control of Microsoft,

      and Microsoft is not responsible for the contents of any third party sites,

      any links contained in third party sites, or any changes or updates to third

      party sites. Microsoft is not responsible for webcasting or any other form of

      transmission received from any third party sites. Microsoft is providing these

      links to third party sites to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of

      any link does not imply an endorsement by Microsoft of the third party site.

      9. ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE/SERVICES. This EULA applies to updates, supplements, 

      add-on components, or Internet-based services components, of the Software that

      Microsoft may provide to you or make available to you after the date you obtain

      your initial copy of the Software, unless we provide other terms along with

      the update, supplement, add-on component, or Internet-based services component.

      Microsoft reserves the right to discontinue any Internet-based services

      provided to you or made available to you through the use of the Software.

      10. UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES Upgrades. To use Software identified as an upgrade,

      you must first be licensed for the software identified by Microsoft as eligible

      for the upgrade. After upgrading, you may no longer use the software that formed

      the basis for your upgrade eligibility.

      Downgrades. Instead of installing and using the Software, you may install and

      use one copy of an earlier version of the Software, provided that you completely

      remove such earlier version and install the original Software within a reasonable

      time. Your use of such earlier version shall be governed by this EULA, and your

      rights to use such earlier version shall terminate when you install the Software.

      11. NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. Software identified as NOT FOR RESALE or NFR,

      may not be sold or otherwise transferred for value, or used for any purpose other

      than demonstration, test or evaluation.

      3. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS AND LICENSE LIMITATIONS.

      If you choose to exercise your rights under Section 2, any redistribution by

      you is subject to your compliance with Section 3.


      3.1 General Distribution Requirements.


      (a) If you choose to redistribute Sample Code, or Redistributable Code

      (collectively, the "Redistributables") as described in Section 2, you agree:

      (i) except as otherwise noted in Section 2.1 (Sample Code), to distribute the

      Redistributables only in object code form and in conjunction with and as a

      part of a software application product developed by you that adds significant

      and primary functionality to the Redistributables ("Licensee Software");

      (ii) that the Redistributables only operate in conjunction

      with Microsoft Windows platforms; (iii) that if the Licensee Software is

      distributed beyond Licensee's premises or externally from Licensee's

      organization, to distribute the Licensee Software containing the

      Redistributables pursuant to an end user license agreement (which may be

      "break-the-seal", "click-wrap" or signed), with terms no less protective

      than those contained in this EULA; (iv) not to use Microsoft's name,

      logo, or trademarks to market the Licensee Software; (v) to display your own

      valid copyright notice which shall be sufficient to protect Microsoft's

      copyright in the Software; (vi) not to remove or obscure any copyright,

      trademark or patent notices that appear on the Software as delivered to you;

      (vii) to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and against any

      claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the

      use or distribution of the Licensee Software; (viii) to otherwise comply with

      the terms of this EULA; and (ix) agree that Microsoft reserves all rights not

      expressly granted.

      You also agree not to permit further distribution of the Redistributables by

      your end users except you may permit further redistribution of the

      Redistributables by your distributors to your end-user customers if your

      distributors only distribute the Redistributables in conjunction with, and as

      part of, the Licensee Software, you comply with all other terms of this EULA,

      and your distributors comply with all restrictions of this EULA that are

      applicable to you.

      (b) If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your compliance with

      the applicable distribution requirements described for the Redistributables,

      the following also applies. Your license rights to the Redistributables are

      conditioned upon your not (i) creating derivative works of the Redistributables

      in any manner that would cause the Redistributables in whole or in part to

      become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License; or (ii) distributing

      the Redistributables (or derivative works thereof) in any manner that would

      cause the Redistributables to become subject to any of the terms of an

      Excluded License. An "Excluded License" is any license that requires as a

      condition of use, modification and/or distribution of software subject to the

      Excluded License, that such software or other software combined and/or

      distributed with such software be (x) disclosed or distributed in source code

      form; (y) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or

      (z) redistributable at no charge.
