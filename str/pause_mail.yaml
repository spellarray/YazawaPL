    Translated: This game uses autosave features. Data will automatically save after certain points in the game such as at the end of event scenarios. You can also save manually from the Pause Menu or at the save points found inside safe rooms in certain areas of the city. Keep in mind that you cannot save during event scenarios and battles. Saving will record your current progress up to that point, which you will be able to resume by selecting Continue from the title screen.

      Need help pounding your enemies? You can call Poundmates for a fee from your smartphone via "Etc." from the battle menu. The roster will grow as you progress through the main story or clear substories.


      Each Poundmate has a powerful ability at a premium cost and are ranked by increasing order of bronze, silver, or gold, with each tier being more powerful and more costly than the former. Some of them will have certain conditions and restrictions, like not being able to help out at night. Plan your strategy accordingly with these factors in mind.

      This popular attraction will have you speeding around the streets of Yokohama in a thrilling race.


      Feel the wind on these karts mounted with custom-designed engines as you hinder your opponents with attacks. But watch outâ€”your opponents can attack you, too, and sustaining too much damage will immobilize you for a period of time. Picking up items during the race and using them wisely will surely help.


      Your kart will have standard specs when starting out, but customization will become available with progress. Check it out near the ship in Hamakita Park when you feel the need for speed.

      You can listen in on short conversations that happen among your party members around the city. Listen until the end, and you'll strengthen the bond between you and your party members. 


      Interrupting these conversations by opening menus or triggering a battle will not only force everyone to stop talking, but it's also just plain rude. If you speak to Iroha at Survive, you can listen to the conversations you've already had.

    Translated: Saeko's inherent boldness makes her much more resistant to fear, charm, and silence than most. She's also particularly good at holding her liquor and is therefore less likely to get drunk.

    Translated: This email is automatically sent to anyone who picks up a Tojo Clan Crest. I'm somewhat of an avid collector of these little treasures. The Tojo Clan was duped by the Omi Alliance and nearly destroyed not too long ago, and it seems that many of the Tojo Clan members' crests had been scattered across the country as a result. I'd hate to see those crests be used for anything wicked, so I want you to assist me with rounding them up! Once you collect a certain number of them, I'll happily trade you for some awesome prizes. All the more reason to bring them my way, wouldn't you say? I'll be in the courtyard of the Grande Blu Marino hotel, on Hamakita Park Ave. in Yokohama. I hope you'll come see me!

To be honest, I didn't expect anyone to actually train so hard they could defeat what I had thought to be an impregnable fortress. So, I have one last trick up my sleeve for those of you thirsting for an even tougher challenge. I call it... the True Final Millennium Tower. The Final Millennium Tower doesn't hold a candle to this baby. I put the entrance in a different place this time. If you think you have what it takes, come by the back door to the Millennium Tower in Kamurocho. I'll be looking forward to meeting you at the very top... again. - The Manager

    Translated: I heard through the grapevine you escaped from the Yokohama Liumang's underground prison? Truth is, the tunnels 'round there go by the name "The Yokohama Underground Dungeon." The place is famous for harboring lots of rare Sujimon you don't see much aboveground. Rumor has it those Yokohama Liumang guys have cleared out too, so the enemies you can encounter should be different now. Tons of 'em are real tough cookies, so it's the perfect place to polish your skills or make some cash. The entrance is the same manhole you came out of when you escaped. I recommend you head inside and find yourself some rare Sujimon.

So there's a manhole behind Theater Square that connects to the sewers, and it looks like it's the brand new stomping grounds for some tough guys who don't show their faces topside very much. Folks in the know call it "The Kamurocho Underground Dungeon."  Pretty good place to polish your skills before you go taking down the final boss, huh? I recommend you head inside and find yourself some rare Sujimon. I'm on your side. Don't lose, Ichiban Kasuga!
