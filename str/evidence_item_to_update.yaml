      Kume's direct cause of death was brain trauma resulting from a stab wound through the eye. The murder weapon is thought to be an ice pick-shaped object. His body also showed signs of being assaulted while still alive.


      Kume's time of death is thought to be between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M. The amount of blood left at the body's location does not match the size of his wound. Therefore, it is thought that his body was relocated from the actual scene of the crime.

      Taken around midnight on the night of the incident, this footage shows Hamura striking Seiya, a host at Stardust, and subsequently leaving the premises. Seiya witnessed Hamura entering Sauna Goten immediately afterward.


      None of the clients at Goten had left the building until the first train arrived the following morning. Since Hamura was among these clients, it is highly likely that he stayed inside Goten until that time as well.

      Many of the details surrounding Mashiba's death show striking similarities to that of his fellow victims, Kume and Kunimura. For example, Mashiba's direct cause of death was a stab wound through the eye that punctured all the way through to the brain. The murder weapon is also thought to be an ice pick-shaped object. Additionally, the amount of blood left at the location where the body was found does not match the size of the wound. Therefore, it is thought that the body was relocated from the actual scene of the crime.


      The victim neither carried a wallet nor a phone, and the actual place where the murder was carried out remains unknown.

The white jersey he wore is similar to the one Captain Hamura of the Matsugane Family wore the day of the incident. As they were the same height, it can be surmised that Hamura was the intended target.

      Released by the ADDC in 2017, the miracle drug known as AD-9 was shown to be astoundingly effective against Alzheimer's during animal testing. It has since received international acclaim for its ability to treat a previously incurable disease.


      The actual man behind the research was Professor Yoji Shono, but in order to garner more attention, Ryusuke Kido (a renowned scientist with a much more public persona) was listed as the author instead.

Then gasoline was spread over the body, making the fire strongest in this area. When firefighters arrived to rescue him, Okubo was surrounded by smoke as he dashed out the entrance.

    Translated: At 10:00 on the night of the incident, members of the Matsugane Family can be seen exiting Amour along with the club's owner. As such, it can be deduced that Hamura was alone in the venue with Kume, the soon-to-be victim. Although Hamura claims to have vacated the premises from the back exit at approximately midnight, there remains no evidence to support this.

    Original:
    - A lawyer who worked for the Genda Law Office. He was found dead in a closet at the Yagami Detective Agency, having suffered one fatal chest wound and two empty eye sockets. Since Shintani was responsible for setting Hamura free, his murder is speculated to have been the work of the Kyorei Clan. However, the fact that his eyes were gouged out considerably dampens this theory, as it resembles the Mole's MO.

    Translated: The culprit behind the Kyorei Clan murders. Gouging out the eyes of his victims appears to be his modus operandi. To date, the Mole has never targeted anyone outside of the Kyorei Clan. However, seeing as how Shintani had his eyes removed in a similar fashion, it is suspected that his death is somehow related to these incidents.

      Captain of the Matsugane Family, a Tojo Clan subsidiary. His rank is equal to second-in-command, just below the family patriarch. However, it is said he has more influence over the Matsugane Family than the patriarch himself.


      Although he was put on trial for murdering Kume, he was proven innocent after his alibi checked out.


      But according to Yagami, there is a chance that Hamura simply took Kume captive and handed him over to the true culprit, who remains at large.


      As of now, Hamura seems to have gone into hiding since the attack on the Matsugane Family Office.

    Translated: "Refers to the serial murders that occurred August through December of 2018. Considering all three victims belonged to the Kyorei Clan, it's assumed these crimes are related to their ongoing turf war with the Tojo Clan. Yet there is another, far more gruesome commonality between them: all had their eyes gouged out by the time they were discovered. The first victim, Kenkichi Mashiba (aged 27) was found dead in Pink Alley. In October, a second victim, Yasuo Kunimura (aged 31), was found lifeless in a back alley off Tenkaichi Street. And a third incident occurred in December, in which Toshiro Kume (aged 34) was similarly discovered in a garbage dump behind Club Amour. As such, Captain Kyohei Hamura of the Tojo Clan was arrested for Kume's murder. But upon prosecution, he was found not guilty, as his alibi checked out. Nevertheless, it is highly likely that Hamura simply handed Kume over to the true killer (referred to as the Mole), who remains at large."

The suspect was arrested on the spot as soon as police arrived at the scene.

    Translated: Masamichi Shintani, a lawyer from the Genda Law Office, has been found dead in Kamurocho. His body was discovered inside the Yagami Detective Agency, having suffered multiple gunshot wounds and hidden in a closet for an undisclosed amount of time. Judging by the trace amounts of blood on the floor, it is assumed that the body was relocated from the actual scene of the crime. Gruesomely enough, both of his eyes were missing from their sockets, as if someone had gouged them out. This is thought to be the work of a killer known as the Mole. Shintani's time of death is currently unknown.

    Translated: In 2015, the body of a previously missing ADDC patient was found in the remote mountains of Okutama. Shinpei Okubo, a linen worker at the ADDC, was subsequently arrested as the suspect. The prosecution presented the case as premeditated murder; Okubo allegedly killed the victim inside the hospital, wrapped the body in sheets, and then dumped it in the mountains. In spite of overwhelming odds, the court determined that Okubo was innocent and he was promptly let go. The defendant responsible for his release was a man named Takayuki Yagami of the Genda Law Office.

Despite the demand for relevant information, only bits and pieces of tangential evidence have been released by the chairman of the Kajihara Group (the ADDC's general contractor).

    Translated: ADDC Vice Director <color=case_file_update>Toru Hashiki (aged 51) was found unconscious after being struck down by an unknown assailant. Many witnesses claimed to have seen a man wearing a black raincoat somewhere in the vicinity right before the attack occurred. Hashiki was carried to the hospital and passed away after being comatose for three weeks. However, his death went largely unnoticed by the media, purportedly due to the lapse of time between the actual incident and the moment he died.

      What originally began as a an apartment fire quickly turned deadly, as firemen who came to the rescue discovered something absolutely chilling: the body of Emi Terasawa, who was killed inside, and her boyfriend, Shinpei Okubo, covered in blood. Okubo was previously thought to be innocent after being charged with an ADDC patient's murder.


      Okubo lived in the apartment with Emi, and his fingerprints were discovered on the knife used to kill her. More than ten stab wounds were found on Emi's body, which was then covered in gasoline and ignited. During his previous trial, Okubo claimed to be abstaining from alcohol, but he was found to be intoxicated at the time of his recent arrest. And though he once again pleaded innocent throughout this second trial, he was ultimately sentenced to death.
