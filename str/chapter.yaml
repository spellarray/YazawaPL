    Translated: Ichiban Kasuga, born and raised in a soapland in Kamurocho without ever knowing his real parents. After his life is saved at the age of fifteen by Masumi Arakawa, a yakuza, Kasuga dedicates his life to serving the Arakawa Family... until the first day of the 21st century. Kasuga is asked by Arakawa to take the fall for Sawashiro, captain of the Arakawa Family, for a murder he had committed. Convinced that the day has finally come for him to repay Arakawa, Kasuga happily obliges and turns himself in to the police.

He is pained by the bullet wound in his chest almost as much as his betrayal at the hands of his hero, Arakawa. Fortunately, the wound is tended to by Nanba, a homeless former nurse. Kasuga's life is saved, but he has no connection to this new city and must rebuild from nothing.
