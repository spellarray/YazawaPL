    Translated: The chance of knocking back an enemy depends on the difference between the attacking character's level and that of the target. If a character's level is lower than the target's, the chances of a knock back are low. Likewise, chances are high if the character's level is higher than the target's. Watch out when you challenge people who are more than 5 levels above you!
